## Key Principles of a Fair Launch

1. **No Pre-Mining or Insider Allocations**:
   - There are no tokens mined or allocated before the public launch. This means that neither the team nor any insiders have an advantage over the community in acquiring the tokens.
2. **Transparent and Open Distribution**:
   - The process for acquiring tokens is transparent and open to everyone. Methods include public mining, open staking, or public listing where everyone has equal access.
3. **Equal Opportunity**:
   - All participants have the same opportunity to acquire tokens. This can be achieved through mechanisms like initial liquidity mining, airdrops, or public listing without preferential pricing.
4. **Decentralized Control**:
   - From the beginning, the project is governed in a decentralized manner, often using a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) where token holders have a say in the governance and future direction of the project.
