## **The Need**

IoTeX users and developers need access to efficient, decentralized AI computation resources, while AI application builders require scalable blockchain infrastructure. By building on IoTeX, Cuckoo Chain addresses these needs while expanding its decentralized AI marketplace to a new ecosystem.

## **The Solution**

Cuckoo Chain on IoTeX delivers:

- Seamless integration with IoTeX's MachineFi infrastructure
- Lower transaction costs for AI model serving
- Enhanced scalability for decentralized AI applications
- Cross-chain interoperability between IoTeX and Cuckoo Chain

## **Airdrop Details**

To celebrate this expansion, Cuckoo Network is launching an airdrop campaign for both IoTeX and Cuckoo community members. Participants can earn $CAI tokens through various engagement activities:

1. Early adopters from IoTeX ecosystem
2. GPU miners contributing to the network
3. Active participation in cross-chain activities
4. Community engagement and development contributions
5. Earn _30%_ of your referees' rewards by sharing your referral link
