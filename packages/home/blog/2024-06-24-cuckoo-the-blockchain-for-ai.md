## Why Choose Cuckoo Chain?

### Lightning Speed

Cuckoo Chain operates at a blistering pace with a max theoretical throughput of 40,000 transactions per second (TPS). Block times are a mere 0.25 seconds, and the time-to-finality is under one minute. This performance opens new possibilities, enabling real-time applications that were previously unimaginable.

### Optimized for On-Chain AI

Cuckoo Chain is tailored for AI integration. It supports the storage of large inference traces and input data, and facilitates running inference requests directly on-chain. This creates a seamless and efficient environment for deploying AI models, making Cuckoo Chain the go-to platform for AI-driven applications.

### Cost Efficiency

One of the standout features of Cuckoo Chain is its cost-effectiveness. Storage and retrieval costs are significantly lower, at $0.001 compared to Ethereum L1's ~$1.44. This drastic reduction in costs makes it more accessible for developers and businesses looking to leverage blockchain technology without breaking the bank.

## Build for the GenAI Era

Cuckoo Chain is designed to meet the needs of the Generation AI era. Its infrastructure supports autonomous, flexible, and adaptable smart contracts, enabling a wide range of applications and use cases.

### Permissionless

With Cuckoo Chain, you can add machine learning (ML) capabilities to smart contracts, making them more autonomous. These contracts can make decisions based on real-time on-chain data, allowing for dynamic and responsive applications.

### Flexible

Cuckoo Chain's flexibility means it can support a broad array of scenarios, including those unforeseen at the time of contract creation. This adaptability ensures that your applications remain relevant and functional as the blockchain landscape evolves.

### Embedded Machine Learning

Cuckoo Chain enables the embedding of ML models directly on-chain. It provides the necessary data storage and availability to support the computational needs of ML applications. This embedded approach streamlines the deployment and management of AI models, enhancing the overall efficiency and capability of your blockchain projects.
