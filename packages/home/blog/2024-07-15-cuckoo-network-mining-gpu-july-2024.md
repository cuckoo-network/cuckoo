Starting from July 2024, Cuckoo Network is rolling out an exciting opportunity for GPU miners: a daily reward of 300 $CAI per GPU. If you've been exploring ways to leverage your GPU for cryptocurrency mining, now's your chance to dive into the Cuckoo ecosystem and maximize your earnings. Let's break down everything you need to know to get started and stay ahead in the mining game.

### What is Cuckoo Network?

Cuckoo Network is a cutting-edge blockchain platform designed to facilitate efficient and decentralized AI computation. By harnessing the power of GPU mining, Cuckoo Network aims to distribute computational tasks across a global network of nodes, ensuring both scalability and security.

### Why GPU Mining?

GPU mining leverages the parallel processing power of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to solve complex mathematical problems, which is integral to blockchain verification processes. Compared to traditional CPU mining, GPU mining offers higher efficiency and better returns, making it an attractive option for miners looking to optimize their setup. Specifically for Cuckoo Network, we mine for text-to-image and generative AI usage.

### How to Get Started with Cuckoo Network Mining

Ready to start mining?

First things first, you'll need a compatible GPU. Cuckoo Network supports a range of GPUs, but for optimal performance and rewards, ensure your hardware meets the recommended specifications:
