Currently, crypto plays a complementary role in AI, offering significant potential for growth. Most organizations are still in the exploratory phase, focusing on the tokenization of computing power (cloud and marketplace), models (AI agents), and data storage.

**Decentralized crypto technology doesn’t directly boost efficiency or reduce costs in AI training but facilitates asset trading, attracting previously unused computing power**. This is profitable in today’s compute-scarce environment. Tokenizing models enables decentralized community ownership or usage, reducing barriers and offering an alternative to centralized AI. However, decentralized data remains challenging to tokenize, requiring further exploration.

While the market hasn’t reached a consensus on AI and crypto, the ecosystem is shaping up. Here are a few categories we will review today: Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud, computing marketplaces, model tokenization and training, AI agents, data tokenization, ZKML, and AI applications.

## Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud

As the AI market grows, GPU cloud computing projects and marketplaces are among the first to benefit. They aim to incorporate unused GPU resources into centralized networks, lowering computing costs compared to traditional services.

These cloud services aren't considered decentralized solutions but are integral parts of the web3 + AI ecosystem. The idea is that GPUs are scarce resources and hold intrinsic value.

Key Projects:

## Computing-resource marketplaces

Decentralized computing-resource marketplaces utilize user-provided GPU and CPU resources for AI tasks, training, and inference. These marketplaces mobilize unused computing power, rewarding participants while reducing barriers to entry.

These GPU computing marketplaces often focus on the narrative of decentralization rather than service utility. Projects like io.net and Nosana, leveraging Solana and DePin concepts, show a huge growth potential. Investing early in GPU markets during peak demand phases can offer high returns through incentives and ROI.

## Model tokenization and training

Model tokenization and training involve converting AI models into valuable assets and integrating them into blockchain networks. This approach allows for decentralized ownership, data sharing, and decision-making. It promises improved transparency, security, and monetization opportunities while creating new investment channels.

The crucial factor is recognizing projects with real innovation and technical challenges. Simply trading ownership or usage rights of AI models isn't true innovation. The real advances come from verifying model outputs effectively and ensuring secure, decentralized model operation.

## AI Agent

AI agents, or intelligent agents, are entities capable of autonomous understanding, memory, decision-making, tool use, and performing complex tasks. These agents not only guide users on "how to" perform tasks but actively assist in completing them. Specifically, this refers to AI agents that interact with blockchain technology for activities like trading, offering investment advice, operating bots, enhancing decentralized finance (DeFi) functionalities, and performing on-chain data analysis.

Such AI agents are closely integrated with blockchain technology, enabling them to generate revenue directly, introduce new trading scenarios, and enhance the blockchain user experience. This integration represents an advanced narrative in DeFi, creating profit through trading activities, attracting capital investment, and fostering hype, which in turn drives a Ponzi scheme-like cycle of investment.

Key Projects:

## Data tokenization

The intersection of AI and cryptography in the data sector holds significant potential, as data and computing power are foundational resources for AI. While decentralized computing can sometimes reduce efficiency, decentralizing data is reasonable because data production is inherently decentralized. Thus, the combination of AI and blockchain in the data sector offers substantial growth potential.

A major challenge in this field is the lack of a mature data marketplace, making effective valuation and standardization of data difficult. Without a reliable valuation mechanism, projects struggle to attract capital through token incentives, potentially breaking the "flywheel effect" even for high-potential projects.
