## **Empowering Decentralized AI with Expanded GPU Resources**

At the heart of this partnership is the integration of Swan Chain's extensive GPU resources into the Cuckoo Network platform. By leveraging Swan Chain's global network of data centers and computing providers, Cuckoo Network will significantly expand its capacity to serve decentralized Large Language Models (LLMs).

This integration aligns perfectly with both companies' visions:

- Cuckoo Network's goal of creating a decentralized AI model serving the marketplace
- Swan Chain's mission is to accelerate AI adoption through comprehensive blockchain infrastructure
