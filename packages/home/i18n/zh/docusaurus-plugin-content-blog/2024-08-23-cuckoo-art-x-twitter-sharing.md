"We are thrilled to provide our users with a seamless way to share their Cuckoo Art creations with the world," said Lark Birdy, CEO of Cuckoo Network.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How does the X/Twitter sharing feature work?

A: After creating or viewing an artwork on Cuckoo Art, users will see a "Share to X" button. Clicking this button will open an X/Twitter post pre-filled with the artwork image and a link to Cuckoo Art. Users can add their own text before posting.

### Q: Do I need to connect my X/Twitter account to Cuckoo Art?

A: No, the sharing feature utilizes X/Twitter's native sharing functionality, so when you click the share button, you will be prompted to log in if you are not already logged into X/Twitter.

### Q: What information will be shared when I post to X/Twitter?

A: The post will include the artwork image, a link to view the artwork on Cuckoo Art, and any additional text you choose to add. By default, the post will also include the hashtag #CuckooArt.

### Q: Can I customize the content shared to X/Twitter?

A: Yes, you can edit the text content of the post before sharing. However, to maintain attribution, the image and link to Cuckoo Art will always be included.

### Q: Will sharing to X/Twitter affect my copyright or ownership of the artwork?

A: No, sharing to X/Twitter does not change your rights to the artwork. You retain all rights as defined in the Cuckoo Art terms of service.

### Q: Is there a limit to how many times I can share to X/Twitter?

A: Cuckoo Art does not impose a limit on this, but please be mindful of X/Twitter's posting guidelines to avoid any issues with their platform.

### Q: Can I share other people's artworks or only my own?

A: You can share any public artwork on Cuckoo Art. When sharing other users' works, the system will automatically include proper attribution.

### Q: Will there be sharing features for other social media platforms in the future?

A: We have launched the X/Twitter integration first, but we are exploring the possibility of expanding to other platforms based on user feedback and demand.

### Q: What benefits does this bring to the Cuckoo Art community?

A: This feature increases exposure for our artists, potentially attracting new users to the platform and helping to build stronger connections between Cuckoo Art and the broader social media community.

### Q: Is there integration with meme ERC20 or ERC721 tokens when sharing to X/Twitter?

A: Currently, the sharing feature focuses on the artwork itself and does not directly integrate with blockchain tokens. However, we are exploring potential future features that would allow users to mint their Cuckoo Art creations as ERC721 NFTs or associate them with ERC20 meme tokens. These tokens could be referenced or showcased when sharing to X/Twitter, adding a layer of blockchain integration and value to the shared content. Stay tuned for this exciting possibility!
