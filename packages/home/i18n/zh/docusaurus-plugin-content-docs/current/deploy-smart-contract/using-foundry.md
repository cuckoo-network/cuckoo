# Deploying with Foundry on Cuckoo Chain

This tutorial will guide you through deploying an ERC20 token on Cuckoo Chain using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/). Foundry is a Rust-based smart contract development toolchain that manages dependencies, compiles projects, runs tests, deploys, and allows interaction with the chain via command-line and Solidity scripts.

Given Cuckoo Chain's foundation on the Arbitrum and Ethereum Stack and its EVM compatibility, Ethereum-based smart contracts can be ported easily with minimal adjustments.

## Prerequisites

You need to complete the following steps, which should take around 10 minutes:

- **Get $CAI on Cuckoo Testnet Network:** Use [this faucet](https://cuckoo.network/portal/faucet/) to claim some CAI.

- **Install Rust:** If Rust is not installed, follow [this guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

- **Install Foundry:** If Foundry is not installed, follow [this guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project

### 1.1 Initialize a New Foundry Project

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
forge init my-project
```

### 1.2 Install OpenZeppelin Contracts

Add the OpenZeppelin contracts library to your project:

```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

## Step 2: Writing the ERC20 Token Contract

### 2.1 Create the Contract File

In the `/src` directory, create a file named `MyERC20.sol` and add the following code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyERC20 is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {}
}
```

This simple ERC20 token is named "MyToken" with the symbol "MTK". You can modify the name and symbol as desired. 

Here's what your project should look like so far:

## Step 3: Building the Contract

### 3.1 Compile the Smart Contract

Use Foundry to compile your contract:

```bash
forge build
```

## Step 4: Deploying the ERC20 Token Contract

### 4.1 Deploy the Contract

To deploy your contract, run the following command, replacing `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>` with your actual private key:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url https://testnet-rpc.cuckoo.network --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> src/MyERC20.sol:MyERC20
```

Never share your private key publicly. Store it safely to prevent unauthorized access.

### Optional: Verify the Contract During Deployment

Add the `--verify` flag to verify your contract during deployment:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url https://testnet-rpc.cuckoo.network --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> src/MyERC20.sol:MyERC20 --verify --verifier blockscout --verifier-url https://testnet-scan.cuckoo.network/api\?
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```bash
[â ¢] Compiling... No files changed, compilation skipped 
Deployer: 0x3F26b51E23D01b09f4079B2a9e00e6873a8409D8 
Deployed to: 0x628F56856386A4De8414A4D8217D519bF94d03f0 
Transaction hash: 0xbe2d27554f130a720c4dd82dad055c941ca44dee836f6333a8507d76022c158
```

Copy and save the "Deployed to" address for later use.

## Step 5: Verifying the Contract After Deployment

### 5.1 Verify the Contract

For contracts already deployed, use the `verify-contract` command:

```bash
forge verify-contract <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> src/MyERC20.sol:MyERC20 --verifier blockscout --verifier-url https://testnet-scan.cuckoo.network/api\?
```

## Step 6: Interacting with Your Deployed Contract

Use [Blockscout](https://testnet-scan.cuckoo.network/) to view your contract's details. Paste the contract address from the deployment output into Blockscout's search bar. In the "Contract" tab, you will find your verified contract.
