## Problem

- **Limited Model Exploration**: AI researchers and applications face restrictions due to resource-intensive infrastructure. Outsourcing to LLM API providers alleviates this but limits model variety.
- **Unsustainable Open Source Innovation**: Independent ML engineers struggle to distribute and monetize their models. Reliance on major infrastructure providers diminishes incentives, hindering sustained innovation.
- **Unequal Market Access**: Vertically integrated companies prioritize enterprise customers and top-tier models, making affordable inference for mid-tier models harder to find.

## Landscape

Centralized AI Inference

The Web3 industry tackles AI decentralization across various layers:

- **Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud**: Akash Network, Ritual, Render, NetMind.AI
- **Computing-Resource Marketplaces**: io.net, Gensyn, nimble, Kuzco, Morpheus AI
- **Model Tokenization and Training**: SaharaLabs, Bittensor, MyShell
- **AI Agents**: SingularityNET, Humans.ai, sensay, ChainGPT, AgentLayer
- **Data Tokenization**: Synesis One, Grass.io, GagaNode, Ocean Protocol
- **AI Applications**: inSure DeFi, Sleepless AI, NFPrompt, Hooked Protocol

We operate within the computing-resource marketplace sector but believe current solutions fail to optimize GPU resources and create immediate value for AI consumers.

## Our Unique Approach

Our decentralized marketplace connects GPU miners with generative AI builders, enabling miners to serve AI models from day one. This maximizes GPU efficiency, reduces centralization risks, and ensures immediate value for AI consumers. By leveraging a decentralized network, we can cut costs for generative AI builders by up to 60%.

## Benefits for GPU Miners

- **Easy Setup and Immediate Earnings**: Start quickly with minimal setup and earn immediately by serving AI models, maximizing hardware investment.

## Benefits for Generative AI App Builders

- **Effortless Integration and Cost Efficiency**: Integrate seamlessly with our API-ready, user-friendly platform. Deploy and scale AI applications quickly while benefiting from up to 60% cost reductions.

Specific Advantages:

- **Broadened Model Exploration**: Access a wider range of models without infrastructure cost constraints, fostering innovation across diverse AI applications.
- **Support for Open Source Innovation**: Distribute and monetize models directly, reducing dependency on major providers and fostering a supportive ecosystem.
- **Equitable Market Access**: Democratize AI model serving with affordable inference for both mid-tier and top-tier models on various hardware, supporting a balanced and competitive market.
