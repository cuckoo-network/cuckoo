# How does Cuckoo work?

## Key Steps

1. **Trust**: GPU miners, developers, and stakers use blockchain smart contracts to establish a trusted environment.
2. **Tasks & Rewards**: Generative AI apps assign tasks to GPU miners via the Cuckoo AI node, with daily ERC20 payments based on task completion and results.
3. **Modular Support**: Our modular components ensure that AI remains accessible, transparent, anti-censorship, and privacy-preserving.

## Design Goals

### For End Customers

- **Access to AI Apps**: Enjoy a variety of AI apps by contributing to the ecosystem or paying with crypto via Cuckoo Pay. If an app is blocked in their region, they can switch to another coordinator within the decentralized network.

### For AI App Builders/Coordinators

- **Run a Coordinator Node**: Stake to join the network, reduce GPU costs, and attract customers from various blockchain ecosystems.
- **Task Management**: Assign tasks to miners, validate results, and handle reward distribution.

### For Miners

- **Run a Task Node**: Stake to join the network and share GPU resources. Earn tokens by completing assigned tasks and maintaining reliable service.

### For Stakers

- **Support the Network**: Vote for trusted coordinators or GPU providers and earn rewards by supporting the network.
