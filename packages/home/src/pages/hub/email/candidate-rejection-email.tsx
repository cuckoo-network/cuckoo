              Candidate rejection emails are an essential part of the hiring process that require careful consideration
              and professional handling. While delivering disappointing news is never easy, a well-crafted rejection
              email can preserve relationships, maintain your company's reputation, and leave candidates with a positive
              impression of your organization. These communications should balance honesty with kindness, provide closure
              while maintaining dignity, and potentially keep doors open for future opportunities. The way you handle
              rejections reflects your company's values and can impact both candidate experience and employer branding.
              Here are over 25 professionally crafted templates for various rejection scenarios to help you communicate
              decisions respectfully and effectively.
