            <ul>
              <li><strong>Time It Right:</strong> Send follow-ups at appropriate intervals - not too soon to seem pushy, not too late to lose relevance.</li>

              <li><strong>Be Clear About Purpose:</strong> State exactly why you're following up and what action you need from the recipient.</li>
              <li><strong>Add Value:</strong> Include helpful information, resources, or insights that benefit the recipient.</li>
              <li><strong>Keep It Concise:</strong> Respect their time with brief, focused messages that get to the point quickly.</li>
              <li><strong>Use Professional Tone:</strong> Maintain appropriate formality level based on your relationship and context.</li>
              <li><strong>Include Context:</strong> Provide enough background so they can easily recall the previous interaction.</li>
              <li><strong>Make It Easy to Respond:</strong> Ask specific questions or provide clear options for next steps.</li>
              <li><strong>Show Persistence, Not Desperation:</strong> Be professional and patient while demonstrating continued interest.</li>
              <li><strong>Plan Your Follow-up Sequence:</strong> Have a strategy for multiple follow-ups if the first doesn't get a response.</li>
            </ul>
