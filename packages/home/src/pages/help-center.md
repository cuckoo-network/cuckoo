## Frequently Asked Questions

### I’ve sent funds to the wrong wallet

Transactions on Cuckoo Chain are irreversible. If you have mistakenly sent funds to the wrong wallet, unfortunately, there is no way to retrieve them. Since no central authority controls Cuckoo Chain, no one can reverse transactions. Always double-check your transactions before sending them.

### How can I claim my Cuckoo Chain giveaway?

Beware of giveaways, as they are often scams aimed at stealing your funds. Offers that seem too good to be true likely are — if you send funds to a giveaway address, you will not receive anything in return and will be unable to recover your funds.

### My transaction is stuck

Transactions on Cuckoo Chain may get stuck if a lower transaction fee is submitted than required due to network demand. Many wallets provide an option to resubmit the same transaction with a higher fee to process the transaction. Alternatively, you can cancel a pending transaction by sending a transaction to your own address using the same nonce as the pending transaction.
