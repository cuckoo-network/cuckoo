# w1 · m1 — Reliability: fix config drift + back up etcd

**Worker:** worker1
**Goal:** Make the currently-live single-node deployment correct and recoverable — the operator must propagate operator-level config changes to running Apps, and App state in etcd must survive a node rebuild.
**Status:** todo

## Tasks (in order)

| id   | title                                                           | est | depends_on |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ---------- |
| t001 | Drop the Reconcile early-return so desired state always applies | 25m | —          |
| t002 | Requeue all Apps on operator startup / config change            | 30m | t001       |
| t003 | etcd snapshot CronJob → Wasabi                                  | 30m | —          |
| t004 | Snapshot retention + documented restore                         | 20m | t003       |

## Definition of done

Flipping an operator-level config (e.g. `BEX_CLUSTER_ISSUER`) re-reconciles every running App with no manual nudge; a daily etcd snapshot lands in Wasabi and a documented restore onto a fresh node recovers the `App` objects.
